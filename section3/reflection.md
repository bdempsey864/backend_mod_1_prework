## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  1. I liked when she said, with a "fixed" mindset, you have a finite amount of information you can learn that is predetermined by your genetics, circumstances, etc, whereas, the "growth" mindset gives you infinite possibilities. If you want to learn something, with enough effort you can!
  2. I also thought it was important to note, that when you set goals, it is very important that they are measurable!

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  1. I try to approach everything I learn as a blank slate. I try to avoid coming in with preconceived notions, and let learning happen as organically as possible.
  2. I struggle with setting measurable goals. I am a bit of a dreamer, so I think big picture. I need to focus more on putting a number or date on something, and achieving it.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  1. An array is a list of items OR values, a hash is a list of items AND values
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  1. ```pet_store = {bones: 217, bowls: 42, collars: 134}```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  1. ```p states[:IA]```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  1.``` p states.keys```
  2.``` p states.values```

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  1. A hash could be used when counting inventory. This is better than array, because you account for the item, as well as the number of items.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  1. none right now, they seem pretty straight forward from what I can tell
