## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
 - It resonated with me because most of the things on there I have learned to incorporate into my learning to help fix bad habits I used to have.
 - The things I already do is:
  1. View learning as a process
  2. Growth mindset
  3. Teach others
  4. Take care of my brain.
 - The two that I need to focus more on are
  1. Reading more
  2. Taking short breaks frequently. I have a bad habit of just plowing through until the work is done at the cost of exhausting myself. And, I just simply need to incorporate more reading into my daily routine.
 - I think an incredibly valuable tool for me is daily exercise! If I couldn't ride my bike or play hockey or something else physical to get rid of stress and get the blood flowing I would struggle a lot more.

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
  - interpolation is using known data to estimate unknown data
  - p "I've seen lions attack a #{animal} when I was in Africa"

8. What method is used to get input from a user?
  - gets.chomp

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

  - puts - puts each string on a different line
