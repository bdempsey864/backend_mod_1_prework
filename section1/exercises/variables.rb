# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
no_return = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p no_return

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
extra_students = students + 2
p students
p extra_students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
fewer_students = students - 2
p students
p "There were #{students} students in the class, but after break there were #{fewer_students}"

# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Blake"
is_hungry = "lunch time"
number_of_pets = 2
p "Hey, I'm #{first_name}, and I'm thinking it's #{is_hungry} because my #{number_of_pets} dogs are starting to whine."
# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?

# Explain.
# I chose to use strings for the first two because it was easier to create a sentence with them, and I used numbers for the last one because it wanted an amount

# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = "Murph"
is_hungry = "dinner"
number_of_pets = 4
p "Hey, I'm #{first_name}, and I'm thinking it's #{is_hungry} because my #{number_of_pets} dogs are starting to whine."


# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;
p "there are #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks} snacks availabe in the kitchen"

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
